Your feature lists are all about understading what your software is supposed to do.
Your use case diagrams let you start thinking about how your software will be used, without getting into a bunch of unnecessary details

The features in your system are what the system does and are not always reflected in your use cases, which show how the system is used. Features and use cases work together, but they are not the same thing.
