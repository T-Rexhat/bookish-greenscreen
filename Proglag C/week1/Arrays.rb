=begin 

Ruby Arrays
    - Lots of special syntax and many provided methods for the Array class
    - Can hold any number of other objects, indexed by number
        - Get via a[i]
        - Set via a[i] = e
    - Compared to arrays in many other languages
        - More flexible and dynamic
        - Fewer operations are errors
        - Less efficient
    - The standard collection (like lists were in ML and Racket)



=end

a = [3, 2, 7, 9] #a[0] = 3, a[2] = 7
