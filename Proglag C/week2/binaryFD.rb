Binary Operations
    Situations is more complicated if an operation is defined over multiple
    arguments that can have different variants
        Can arise in original program or after extension

    FD deals with this much more simply....


To show the issue:
    - Include variants String and Rational
    - (Re)define Add to work on any pair of Int, String, Rational
        Concatentation if either argument a String, else math
