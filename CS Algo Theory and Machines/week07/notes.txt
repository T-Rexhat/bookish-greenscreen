A COMPUTING MACHINE
===================

TOY is an imaginary machine similar to:
- Ancient computers
- Today's smartphone processors
- Countless other devices desinged and built over the past 50 years
- Everything in TOY is encoded with a sequnce of bits (value 0 or 1)
-- Why? Easy to represent two states (on and off) in real world
-- Bits are organized in 16-bit sequences called words

More convenient for humans: hexadecimal notation
- 4 hex digits in each word
- convert to and form binary 4 bits at a time

Components of TOY machine
- Memory (Holds data and instructions)
-- 256 words
-- 16 bits in each word
-- Connected to registers
-- Words are addressable --> use hexadecimal for addresses --> Number words from 00 to FF

- Registers
-- 16 words, addressable in hex from 0 to F (use names R[0] through R[F])
-- Scratch space for calculations and data movements
-- Connected to memory and ALU
-- By convention, R[0] is always 0.

- Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)
-- TOY's computational engine
-- A calculator, not a computer
-- Hardware that implements all data-type operations

- Program Counter (PC) --> memory address of next instruction
- Instruction register (IR) --> instructions being executed

-- Fetch increment execute cycle
--- Fetch: Get instruction from memory into IR
--- Increment: Update PC to point to next instruction
--- Execute: Move data to or from memory, change PC, or perform calc, as specified by IR


A data type is a set of values and a set of operations on those values
TOY's data type is 16-bit two's complemenet integers.

Two kinds of operations
- Arithmetic
- Bitwise

All other types of data must be implemeneted with software
- 32 bit and 64 bit integers
- 32 bit and 64 bit floating point values
- Characters and strings
