A typical client: Whitelist filter
- A blacklist is a list of entities to be rejected for service
- A whitelist is a list of entities to be accepted for service

whiteliest filter
- read a list of strings from a whitelist file
- read strings from stdin and write to stdout only those in the whitelist


using compareTo method is useful in this case because it turns string into numbers based on the
return Integer value of its comparison. Will be useful if you want to make a method that accepts multiple types (generic)

Binary Sort:
- Works with sorted arrays
- Big O notation is log(n)
- Halves the searching
- can do it through recursive or non-recursive ways

Insertion Sort:
- Moves down through the array.
- Each item bubbles up above the larger ones above it
- Everything above the current item is in order
- Everything below the current item is untouched
- Big O notation is N**2


Need algorithms that scale to keep pace with Moore's law

Merge Sort:
- Divide array into two halves
- Recursively sort each half
- Merge two halves to make sorted whole

Abstract inplace merge
- Merge a[lo, mid) with a [mid, hi)
- Use auxiliary array for result
- Copy back when merge is complete
