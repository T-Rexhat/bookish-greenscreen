Central Processing Unit
=======================

Basic design of our circuits
- Organized as componenets (functional units of TOY: ALU, memory, register, PC, & IR)
- Connected by busses (groups of wires that propagate information between computer)
- Controlled by control lines (single wires that control circuit behavior)

Conventions:
- Bus inputs are at the top, input connections are at the left
- Bust outputs are at the bottom, output connections are at the right
- Control lines are blue

Loops in circuit lead to time-varying behavior
- Sequence of switch operation matters
- Need tight control

Two switches each blocked bt the other
- State determiend by whichever switches first
- Stable (once set, state never changes)
- Basic building block for memory circuit

Three switches, blocked in a cycle
- State determined by whichever switches first
- Not stable (cycles through states)

An SR flip-flop controls feedback
- Add control lines to switches in simple feedback loop
- R (reset) sets state to 0
- S (set) sets state to 1
- Q (state) is always available

Add logic to an SR flip-flop for more precise control
- Provide data value on an input wire instead of using S and R controls
- Use WRITE control wire to enable change in flip-flop values
- Flip-flop value always available as output
