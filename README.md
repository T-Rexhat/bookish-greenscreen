<li>**Programming Foundatons with HTML,CSS,JavaScript from Duke**</li> <br>
<p> In week 1 & 2, they will teach you on how to use HTML & CSS. While, in week 3 & 4, they will teach you how to use JavaScript to manipulate pixels. I dont think this course is for beginner because they introduce too many programming language at the same time. In addition, the instructor is also introducing for-loop principles in javascript without teaching the basic foundation of javascript such as operations/booleans. However, the good things about this course is the programming assignments/projects are fun & interesting!!! </p> <br>

<li> **Python Classes Inheritance - U-Michigan** </li> <br>
<p>The course is pretty easy & straightforward. You will learn how to use classes, inhertiance, changing/renewing methods in a new class you made. 
The most memorable moments from this course
is implementing python classes to make a pokemon & wheel of fortune game. </p> <br>

<li> **Runestone Academy with Algorithm & Data Structure in Python** </li> <br>
<p>This course will teach you the basics of data structure & algorithm commonly used in computer science
using python as the programming language.
I completed this textbook up until binary search trees & graph sections. I would not study BST & graph using this book because they explain it poorly. There are far
better resources than learning from this complicated book.</p> <br>

<li> **How to code - Simple** </li> <br>
<p> This course is definitely for programming beginners and a concept refresher for functional programming. The first part (HtC-Simple) is really a well-made computer science course because it introduces you to the world of Computer Science by teaching its programming concept through variety & fun assignments. One of the most memorable moment in this course is coding to create a rain simulation & a cat game. However, the only downside of this course is using a programming language called Racket which is not widely used in the industry. </p>  

<p><strong>Course Rating: 8.5/10</strong></p>

<li> **How to code - Complex** </li> <br>
A continutation from HtC-Simple which introduces more advance concept such as trees, graphs, localization, mutual recursion, abstraction, and many more. In my opinion, the instructor did far better explaining in HtC-Simple than in HtC-Complex. The assignments were tough, yet rewarding (looking at the final project). Due to the assignment being tough & time consuming, this course is not suitable in edX which they will cut off your access to this course if you go beyond the deadline. Therefore, I opted to watch HtC-Complex courses on Youtube.

<li> **Programming Languages Part A** </li> <br>
For me, this course is hard because I personally never learn a common static programming languages like C++/Java. Hence, I struggled in many data types & let concepts. Furthermore, the whole course is a re-iteration of the HtC courses because many of the concept they teach in this class is similar. For example, currying, nested, map/filter, recomputation, mutual recursion, and tail recursion. However, the most memorable moment of this course is studying pattern matching which introduces a new cool concept in programming language. As I started to learn Java, I've found that Java also has a feature that is similar to pattern matching called switch & case. 

 <li> **Programming Languages Part B** </li> <br>  
This course should be a breeze if you have finished with HtC courses. The challenging part of this course is the final assignment which you need to create your own language or something. I didnt even try to finish it because I already forgot how to do racket (LOL), so I just skimmed the lecture slides and ONLY do the first assignment. This course is kinda meh for me, I think part A has better lecture & assignments.

 <li> **Computer Science: Programming With A Purpose** </li> <br>
I think this course has a similar vibe with the HtC courses with the twist being harder & more mathematical. I think this is by far the best course for java beginners because it teaches you everything from standard I/O to recursion & basic OOP. The questions here are way harder than the HtC courses because it revolves more on mathematics & physics rather than just your standard programming. Hence, thats why the course teaches you on how to solve problems in a computer science way rather than just teaching you normal programming concept (one of the reasons why that the name of this course is programming with a purpose). I think the most valuable moment I've learnt from this course is to think first before you code (you cannot code if you dont know the solution to this problem). Either way, this course also being taught by excellent instructors (Sedgewick & Wayne) provided with good & simple lecture slides.
