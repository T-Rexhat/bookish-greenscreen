<li>**Programming Foundatons with HTML,CSS,JavaScript from Duke**</li> <br>
<p> In week 1 & 2, they will teach you on how to use HTML & CSS. While, in week 3 & 4, they will teach you how to use JavaScript to manipulate pixels. I dont think this course is for beginner because they introduce too many programming language at the same time. In addition, the instructor is also introducing for-loop principles in javascript without teaching the basic foundation of javascript such as operations/booleans. However, the good things about this course is the programming assignments/projects are fun & interesting!!! </p> <br>

<li> **Python Classes Inheritance - U-Michigan** </li> <br>
<p>The course is pretty easy & straightforward. You will learn how to use classes, inhertiance, changing/renewing methods in a new class you made. 
The most memorable moments from this course
is implementing python classes to make a pokemon & wheel of fortune game. </p> <br>

<li> **Runestone Academy with Algorithm & Data Structure in Python** </li> <br>
<p>This course will teach you the basics of data structure & algorithm commonly used in computer science
using python as the programming language.
I completed this textbook up until binary search trees & graph sections. I would not study BST & graph using this book because they explain it poorly. There are far
better resources than learning from this complicated book.</p> <br>

<li> **How to code - Simple** </li> <br>
<p> This course is definitely for programming beginners and a concept refresher for functional programming. The first part (HtC-Simple) is really a well-made computer science course because it introduces you to the world of Computer Science by teaching its programming concept through variety & fun assignments. One of the most memorable moment in this course is coding to create a rain simulation & a cat game. However, the only downside of this course is using a programming language called Racket which is not widely used in the industry. </p>  

<p><strong>Course Rating: 8.5/10</strong></p>

<li> **How to code - Complex** </li> <br>
A continutation from HtC-Simple which introduces more advance concept such as trees, graphs, localization, mutual recursion, abstraction, and many more. In my opinion, the instructor did far better explaining in HtC-Simple than in HtC-Complex. The assignments were tough, yet rewarding (looking at the final project). Due to the assignment being tough & time consuming, this course is not suitable in edX which they will cut off your access to this course if you go beyond the deadline. Therefore, I opted to watch HtC-Complex courses on Youtube.
