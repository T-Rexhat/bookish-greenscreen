Discover a variety of Computer Science MOOCs from platforms like Coursera, edX, Udemy, LinkedIn, and MIT OpenCourseWare. Below, I've provided brief overviews and personal ratings for each course.

### **Programming Foundations with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - Duke University**
In the first two weeks, this course focuses on HTML and CSS, while the following two weeks dive into JavaScript for pixel manipulation. It's worth noting that this course might not be suitable for complete beginners, as it introduces multiple programming languages simultaneously. However, it shines in the realm of programming assignments and projects, offering an enjoyable and engaging learning experience.

**Course Rating: 6/10**

### **Python Classes Inheritance - University of Michigan**
This course is straightforward and easy to follow, covering classes, inheritance, and method modifications within new classes. Notably, it provides hands-on experience creating Python programs like Pok√©mon and Wheel of Fortune games.

**Course Rating: 7/10**

### **Runestone Academy: Algorithm & Data Structures in Python**
This course offers a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science, with Python as the programming language of choice. However, the explanations for binary search trees and graph sections might not be the best. Better resources are available for learning these topics.

**Course Rating: 5/10**

### **How to Code - Simple**
Ideal for programming beginners, this course provides a concept refresher for functional programming. It excels in introducing programming concepts through diverse and enjoyable assignments. However, it employs the less widely-used Racket programming language, which may limit its industry applicability.

**Course Rating: 8.5/10**

### **How to Code - Complex**
Continuing from "How to Code - Simple," this course delves into advanced concepts, such as trees, graphs, localization, mutual recursion, and abstraction. While the assignments are challenging, they offer rewarding experiences. Note that the course can be time-consuming and should be completed within the given deadlines.

**Course Rating: 6/10**

### **Programming Languages Part A**
This course can be challenging, especially if you have no prior experience with common static programming languages like C++ or Java. It covers various concepts similar to those in the "How to Code" courses. A standout feature is the study of pattern matching, introducing a new programming concept.

**Course Rating: 7/10**

### **Programming Languages Part B**
If you've completed the "How to Code" courses, this course should be manageable. The final assignment, involving the creation of your programming language, is the most challenging part. However, if you've forgotten the Racket programming language, this course may pose difficulties.

**Course Rating: 6/10**

### **Computer Science: Programming With A Purpose**
This course shares similarities with the "How to Code" courses but delves deeper into mathematical and more complex concepts. It's an excellent choice for Java beginners, as it covers standard I/O, recursion, and basic OOP, with a strong focus on problem-solving in a computer science context.

**Course Rating: 8.7/10**

### **Programming Languages Part C**
The first part of the assignment involves fixing a Tetris code using OOP principles. The second part may be challenging, involving code corrections using SML and creating a geometric shapes software using Ruby.

**Course Rating: 7/10**

### **Intro to Java: Fundamentals & OOP**
This course is available on YouTube and covers Java comprehensively. Consider using the "Head First Java" book as a supplementary resource, as it provides an engaging and informative approach to learning Java.

Overall, these courses offer a diverse range of experiences, from 
beginner-friendly options to more advanced challenges. Make your choice 
based on your proficiency level and personal preferences. (Almost complete
