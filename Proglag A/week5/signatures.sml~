(* a singature is a type for a module
- What bindings does it have and what are their types

Can define a signature and ascribe it to modules - example

 *)

signature MATHLIB =
sig
    val fact : int -> int
    val half_pi : int
    val doubler : int -> int
end

structure MyMathLib :> MATHLIB =
struct
fun fact x =
val half_pi = Math.pi / 2
fun doubler x = x * 2
end
