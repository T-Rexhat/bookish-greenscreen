Syntax: if e1 then e2 else e3, where if, then, and else are keywords and
e1, e2, and e3 are subexpressions

type-checking: first e1 must have type bool, e2 & e3 can have any type,
but they must have the same type t
the type of the entier expression is also t

evaluation rules:
first evaluate e1 to a value call it v1
if its true, evaluate e2 and that result is the whole expressions resulst
else, evaluate e3 and that result is the whole expression result
