(* What is type inference?

type-checking reject a program before runs to prevent some errors
=> a feature of statically tuped languages

dynamically typed languages do little such checking

racket is a dynamically typed

ML (and Java, C#, Scala, C, C++) is statically typed
- every binding has one type, determined "at compile time"

ML is statically typed & implicityly typed: rarely need to write down types
